# ImGui_single-board_OpenGL 

OpenGL for small single-board computers using the [Dear ImGui C++ library](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)


Make sure you have the GCC compiler installed. The `glfw` library is also needed. 
It is definitelly way easier if you have the Qt Creators IDE installed, if so just run the CMakeLists.txt 
inside the Qt creators and that it! (Qt creators is not needed, but it does have all the development dependancies needed)
